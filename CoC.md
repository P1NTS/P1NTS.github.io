# CODE OF CONDUCT

P1NTS is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, social class and background, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality, or the presence of or care for dependents. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organisers.


**Harassment** includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, social class and background, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour


### Enforcement

Participants asked by the event organisers to stop any harassing behavior are required to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organisers retain the right to take any necessary actions to keep the P1NTS event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event. Organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.  

Additionally, participants asked by another attendee to stop any behavior perceived as harassing, threatening, or otherwise unpleasant are expected to comply within reasonable limits. If a participant considers such a request unreasonable they may raise the issue with the organisers.


### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. People like you make our scientific community a better place, and we want you to be happy here.  

Harassment or non-inclusive behavior is defined by you. So, do not hesitate to report something because someone else thinks the behavior is "reasonable". That person may not share your protected characteristic(s).  

You can make a report by emailing one of the organisers. You may report the incident to any one of the organising committee members that you feel most comfortable reporting to. The person you report to may share the information with the other organisers.


### What happens if I make a report?

We will investigate your report to the fullest extent possible and take all feasible actions to prevent a recurrence. When taking a report, our team will adhere to the strictest confidence in handling the report. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You will never be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.  

We value your attendance.
